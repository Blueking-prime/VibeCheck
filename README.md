# VibeCheck

The project helps create Spotify playlists according to specific moods. It's designed for every music lover. From those who donâ€™t want to have to get out of the shower because that one track comes on, or those who want to focus on their workout without having to skip through the non-hype songs. The app is designed to specifically use the user's own saved tracks and not just a collection of tracks that Spotify recommends.
